## Future Post-v1.0 Roadmap

1.  **Multi-Person Telemetry Extension:** Extend the pipeline to analyze cognitive-emotional modes of 3+ simultaneous participants.
2.  **Voice Prosody Fusion:** Train an audio model to augment the face Action Unit weights with pitch/prosody emotion classifiers.
3.  **Cross-Platform Client UI:** Port the WPF app to Avalonia UI for native Linux and macOS support.
